# Download cache directory

During the OpenWrt build, many sources will be downloaded from the internet.
To speed up the OpenWrt build, cached packages can be used from this directory.
These sources are not part of this Github repository (because of size).
To create you own cache, copy the downloaded files from the first intermediate image from `/home/vera/archive/dl/` into this directory.
